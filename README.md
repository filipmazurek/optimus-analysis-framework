Optimus Analysis Framework

## Installation

### Conda: Installation From Source

This is recommended for further development of the SPA library.

We provided a Conda environment file to set up the correct environment.

First, clone this repository. Then:
```shell
$ cd optimus-analysis-framework/
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate oaf
```

This will install the OAF library in editable mode, so that changes in the repository will reflect in the installation.

## Usage
Please refer to `examples/` for recommended usage of the OAF library.
